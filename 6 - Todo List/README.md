# Todo List
A simple todo list that allows you to create, update, delete and view the todos in the todo list. Using OOP principles, the list is functional on the command line. I also added unit tests using JUnit.

## Example
```plaintext
================================

Commands:
add: add a todo to list
remove: remove todo from list
print: print your todo list
set: set if task is complete
end: quit application

================================

Enter your command: add
Add new todo: Clean my room

Clean my room successfully added!

Enter you command: print

Enter your command: remove
Remove a todo: Wash dishes

Ending application...
